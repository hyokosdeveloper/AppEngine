    <p>Here are two example Suggestion Box applications that are the same, except they do paging differently.</p>
    
    <p><b><a href="/unique/">Unique</a></b>: Creates a unique value for each suggestion and uses that as the property to query on when paging.</p>

    <p><b><a href="/key/">__key__</a></b>: Uses the <code>__key__</code> propery in addition to the
     'created' property to do paging without creating an extra property that is guaranteed unique.</p>
