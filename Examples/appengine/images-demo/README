Images-demo demonstrates the capabilities of the Google App Engine images API.
It lets you interactively apply the available transforms to a selected image.

A running version of the demo is available at http://images-demo.appspot.com/

You can include your own images in the 'samples' directory.

The images api uses the Python Imaging Library locally to transform images
during testing on your local machine. You'll need to download the PIL module
and install it on your local machine to use the imaging api with the SDK.
